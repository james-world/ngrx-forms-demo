# TeamBuilder

This project is a demonstration of using NgRx and ngrx-forms. ngrx-forms looks similar on the surface to reactive-forms, but offers the compelling advantage of having immutable data-structures and being manipulating through actions in the NgRx/Redux style.

This code demonstrates/uses:

- NgRx
- ngrx-forms - inc. built in support for asynchronous validation
- jest
- Angular Material
- Marble Testing
- Use of CDK Virtual Scroll

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via jest
